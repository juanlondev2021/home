                            <b>Promise To Pay:</b> You promise to pay the 
                            Amount Financed, together with interest figured 
                            on the unpaid balances of the Amount Financed and 
                            finance charges, according to the Annual Percentage 
                            Rate and your payment schedule shown on the front of 
                            this Contract. Interest is computed on a simple interest 
                            basis.

                            <b>Security:</b> You give us a security interest in the 
                            goods you are purchasing ("Collateral"). Our security interest 
                            secures your performance of all obligations under this Contract 
                            and any extensions, renewals or modifications of it. You also 
                            authorize us to make any filing with respect to the Collateral 
                            that we decide is reasonably necessary to preserve the Collateral, 
                            or to establish priority of, perfect, continue perfected, or enforce 
                            our interest in it or our rights under the agreement. This includes the 
                            authorization to make a fixture filing against any real estate to which 
                            the Collateral is affixed or attached. The decision about what is reasonably 
                            necessary is ours alone.
                        </p>

                            <b>Maintenance Of Collateral:</b> You will maintain the Collateral in good 
                            condition and repair; not permit its value to be impaired; keep it free from 
                            all liens or encumbrances prior in right to ours; and not allow it to become a 
                            fixture to other property without our consent. To the greatest extent permitted 
                            by applicable law, you agree that if the Collateral is affixed or attached to any 
                            real estate, it shall remain as personal property and shall not be deemed as a part 
                            of the real estate. You will not sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of the Collateral 
                            without our written permission. Loss or damage of the Collateral does not release you 
                            of your obligation to make payments when due. We may inspect the Collateral at reasonable 
                            times and you will assist us in such inspections to insure compliance with this Contract. 
                        </p>

                            <b>Assignment:</b> We may assign this Contract and any of our rights under this Contract 
                            without your consent, and the Assignee is entitled to all of our rights under the Contract. 
                            Your rights will not be affected by such an assignment. If you sell or transfer all or any 
                            part of the security interest or sell or transfer the Collateral or any real property to which 
                            the Collateral is affixed, we may, at our option, require immediate payment of all outstanding 
                            sums under this Contract. Fee for Returned Checks/Insufficient Funds: If you give us a check in 
                            payment of an installment on this Contract, and that check is returned unpaid by your bank, we will 
                            charge you a fee of $25.00 or the actual charge assessed to us, whichever is greater. If we attempt 
                            to make an electronic fund transfer, with your authorization, and there are insufficient funds we will 
                            charge you a fee of $25.00. 
                        </p>

                            <b>Prepayment:</b> You may prepay your balance at any time and you will not have to pay a penalty. 
                            You will not be entitled to a refund of part of the finance charge, except for unearned finance charges. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-size: 12px; margin: 0;">
                            <b>Default:</b> You are in default if you fail to make one or more payments when due, or you breach 
                            any representation or warranty made by you in this Contract, or you take any action that materially 
                            impairs the value of the Collateral. If you are in default, we can require you to pay the remaining 
                            balance of this Contract all at once and immediately. If you are in default, we also have all the rights 
                            and remedies Arizona law permits, including the right to repossess the Collateral. We may then resell the 
                            Collateral, in accordance with the procedures and after giving any notices required pursuant to applicable law. 
                            If the original cash price was more than $1,000 and we repossess or accept voluntary surrender of the Collateral, 
                            you shall pay the difference between the sale proceeds and what you owe. If you are in default and we refer this Contract 
                            to an attorney who is not our salaried employee for collection, you agree to pay our reasonable attorneys' fees. To the extent 
                            not prohibited by law, you agree to pay any other costs and fees of repossession, collection, or realization of any security interest, 
                            including but not limited to court costs. Credit Report Agreement and Notice: You agree we may investigate your credit, employment, and 
                            financial status. You authorize us to obtain a credit report and any other information about your creditworthiness in connection with processing 
                            your application for credit, and subsequently in connection with any renewal or update of your Contract, or to take collection action on this Contract, 
                            or to investigate disputes regarding this Contract and your debt to us. At your request, we will inform you if such reports were ordered, and the names 
                            of the credit bureaus that provided reports. You authorize the Department of Defense and the various departments and commands to verify your social security 
                            number or other identifier and disclose your home address to the authorized holder of the contract for purposes of performing or enforcing the terms of this 
                            Agreement. You authorize any past or present employer to confirm employment or communicate with us regarding your indebtedness to us if you fail to meet the 
                            terms and conditions of this Agreement. We will use all information furnished solely in connection with performing or enforcing the terms of this Agreement.
