                    date or amount changes, in which case you will receive notice from Aqua Bright Water, LLC at least 10 days prior to the payment being
                    collected. You understand that this authorization will remain in effect until you cancel it in writing, and you agree to notify Aqua 
                    Bright Water, LLC in writing of any changes in my account information or termination of this authorization at least 15 days prior to 
                    the next billing date. If the above noted periodic payment dates fall on a weekend or holiday, you understand that the payment may be 
                    executed on the next business day.  You understand that because this is an electronic transaction, these funds may be withdrawn from
                    my account as soon as the above noted periodic transaction dates. In the case of an ACH Transaction being rejected for Non Sufficient
                    Funds (NSF) You understand that  Aqua Bright Water, LLC may at its discretion attempt to process the charge again within 30 days, and 
                    agree to an additional  $25.00 charge for each attempt returned NSF which will be initiated as a separate transaction from the 
                    authorized recurring payment. You acknowledge that the origination of ACH transactions to your account must comply with the provisions 
                    of U.S. law.

                <p align="justify">
                    AQUA BRIGHT WATER warrants that all work performed will be completed in a workmanlike manner and that all parts and equipment which are installed are free from defects. In the event that any part of the Reverse Osmosis or Softener (“Unit”) becomes defective, or in the event that any repairs are required, AQUA BRIGHT WATER agrees to make all repairs and supply replacement parts without cost to the Customer for a period of one (1) years from the date the work was done, subject to the exclusions below.  AQUA BRIGHT WATER reserves the option to either replace or repair the Unit, and reserves the right to substitute materials of equal quality at time of replacement, or to use reconditioned parts in fulfillment of this warranty.  Written warranty claims specifying the defect must be received by AQUA BRIGHT WATER within the one (1) year warranty period. All warranty issues must be allowed to be inspected and approved by AQUA BRIGHT WATER before any warranty repair is made. AQUA BRIGHT WATER is not the manufacturer of the Unit, and other than AQUA BRIGHT WATER’s limited warranty, Customer agrees to look exclusively to the manufacturer of the equipment for repairs under its warranty coverage if any.
