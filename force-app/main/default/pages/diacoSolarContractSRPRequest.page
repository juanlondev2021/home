                                <i>Special rules for partnerships.</i> Partnerships that conduct a trade or business in the
                                United States are generally required to pay a withholding tax under section 1446 on any foreign
                                partners’ share of effectively connected taxable income from such business. Further, in certain
                                cases where a Form W-9 has not been received, the rules under section 1446 require a partnership
                                to presume that a partner is a foreign person, and pay the section 1446 withholding tax.
                                Therefore, if you are a U.S. person that is a partner in a partnership conducting a trade
                                or business in the United States, provide Form W-9 to the partnership to establish your U.S.
                                status and avoid section 1446 withholding on your share of partnership income.

                                a trade or business in the United States.

                                may use the terms of a tax treaty to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on certain types of income.
                                However, most tax treaties contain a provision known as a “saving clause.” Exceptions specified
                                in the saving clause may permit an exemption from tax to continue for certain types of income
                                even after the payee has otherwise become a U.S. resident alien for tax purposes.
                                <br/> If you are a U.S. resident alien who is relying on an exception contained in the saving
                                clause of a tax treaty to claim an exemption from U.S. tax on certain types of income, you
                                must attach a statement to Form W-9 that specifies the following five items.

                                United States exceeds 5 calendar years. However, paragraph 2 of the first Protocol to the
                                U.S.-China treaty (dated April 30, 1984) allows the provisions of Article 20 to continue
                                to apply even after the Chinese student becomes a resident alien of the United States. A

                                What is backup withholding? Persons making certain payments to you must under certain conditions withhold and pay to the
                                IRS 24% of such payments. This is called “backup withholding.” Payments that may be subject
                                to backup withholding include interest, tax-exempt interest, dividends, broker and barter
                                exchange transactions, rents, royalties, nonemployee pay, payments made in settlement of
                                payment card and third party network transactions, and certain payments from fishing boat
                                operators. Real estate transactions are not subject to backup withholding.
                                <br/> You will not be subject to backup withholding on payments you receive if you give the requester
                                your correct TIN, make the proper certifications, and report all your taxable interest and
                                dividends on your tax return.

                                    The IRS tells you that you are subject to backup withholding because you did not report all your interest and dividends on

                                    a Form W-9. This is the case even if the foreign person has a U.S. TIN

                                get this form online at www.SSA.gov. You may also get this form by calling 1-800-772-1213.
                                Use Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, to apply for
                                an ITIN, or Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number, to apply for an EIN.
                                You can apply for an EIN online by accessing the IRS website at www.irs.gov/Businesses and
                                clicking on Employer Identification Number (EIN) under Starting a Business. Go to www.irs.gov/Forms
                                to view, download, or print Form W-7 and/or Form SS-4. Or, you can go to www.irs.gov/OrderForms
                                to place an order and have Form W-7 and/or SS-4 mailed to you within 10 business days.

                                If you are asked to complete Form W-9 but do not have a TIN, apply for a TIN and write “Applied For” in the space for the
                                TIN, sign and date the form, and give it to the requester. For interest and dividend payments,
                                and certain payments made with respect to readily tradable instruments, generally you will
                                have 60 days to get a TIN and give it to the requester before you are subject to backup withholding
                                on payments. The 60-day rule does not apply to other types of payments. You will be subject
                                to backup withholding on all such payments until you provide your TIN to the requester.

                                without your permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. An identity thief may use your
                                SSN to get a job or may file a tax return using your SSN to receive a refund.
                                <br/>
                                <br/> To reduce your risk:

                                Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code requires you to provide your correct TIN to persons (including federal agencies)

                                returns with the IRS, reporting the above information. Routine uses of this information include
