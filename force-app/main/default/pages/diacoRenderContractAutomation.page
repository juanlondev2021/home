                        Here’s How Recurring Payments Work:
                        <br/>
                        <br/> You authorize regularly scheduled charges to your checking or savings account. You will be charged
                        the amount indicated above each billing period. A receipt for each payment will be emailed to you.
                        You agree that no prior-notification will be provided unless the date or amount changes, in which
                        case you will receive notice from us at least 10 days prior to the payment being collected. You understand
                        that this authorization will remain in effect until you cancel it in writing, and You agree to notify
                        PROTECTION SOURCE in writing of any changes in your account information or termination of this authorization
                        at least 15 days prior to the next billing date. If the above noted periodic payment dates fall on
                        a weekend or holiday, You understand that the payment may be executed on the next business day. You
                        understand that because this is an electronic transaction, these funds may be withdrawn from my account
                        as soon as the above noted periodic transaction dates. In the case of an ACH Transaction being rejected
                        for Non Sufficient Funds (NSF) I understand that PROTECTION SOURCE may at its discretion attempt
                        to process the charge again within 30 days, and agree to an additional $25.00 charge for each attempt
                        returned NSF which will be initiated as a separate transaction from the authorized recurring payment.
                        You acknowledge that the origination of ACH transactions to my account must comply with the provisions
                        of U.S. law.

                            PS does not assume any responsibility for the manner in which such signals are monitored or the
                            response, if any, to such signals.

                            Subscriber acknowledges that signals which are transmitted over telephone lines, wire, air waves, internet, VOIP, radio or
                            cellular, or other modes of communication pass through communication networks wholly beyond the
                            control of PS and are not maintained by PS except PS may own the radio network, and PS shall
                            not be responsible for any failure which prevents transmission signals from reaching the central
                            office monitoring center or damages arising therefrom, or for data corruption, theft or viruses
                            to Subscriber’s computers if connected to the alarm communication equipment. Subscriber agrees
                            to furnish PS with a written Call List of names and telephone numbers of those persons Subscriber
                            wishes to receive notification of alarm signals. Unless otherwise provided in the Call List PS
                            will make a reasonable effort to contact the first person reached or notified on the list either
                            via telephone call, text or email message. No more than one call to the list shall be required
                            and any form of notification provided for herein, including leaving a message on an answering
                            machine, shall be deemed reasonable compliance with PS’s notification obligation. All changes
                            and revisions shall be supplied to PS in writing. Subscriber authorizes PS to access the control
                            panel to input or delete data and programming. If the equipment contains video or listening devices
                            permitting central office to monitor video or sound then upon receipt of an alarm signal central
                            office shall monitor video or sound for so long as central office in its sole discretion deems
                            appropriate to confirm an alarm condition. If Subscriber requests PS to remotely activate or
                            deactivate the system, change combinations, openings or closings, or re-program system functions,
                            Subscriber shall pay PS $90.00 for each such service. PS may, without prior notice, suspend or
                            terminate its services, in central office’s sole discretion, in event of Subscriber’s default
                            in performance of this agreement or in event central office facility or communication network
                            is nonoperational or Subscriber’s alarm system is sending excessive false alarms. Central office
                            is authorized to record and maintain audio and video transmissions, data and communications,

                            all cases the remote video server. In consideration of Subscriber making its monthly payments
                            for remote access to the system PS will authorize Subscriber access. PS is not responsible for
                            Subscriber’s access to the Internet or any interruption of service or down time of remote access
                            caused by loss of Internet service, radio or cellular or any other mode of communication used
                            by Subscriber to access the system. Subscriber acknowledges that Subscriber's security system
                            can be compromised if the codes or devices used for access are lost or accessed by others and
                            PS shall have no liability for such third party unauthorized access. PS is not responsible for
                            the security or privacy of any wireless network system or router. Wireless systems can be accessed

                            7. LIMITED WARRANTY ON SALE: In the event that any part of the security system becomes defective, or in the event that any
                            repairs are required, PS agrees to make all repairs and replacement of parts without costs to
                            the Subscriber for a period of one (1) year from the date of installation. PS reserves the option
                            to either replace or repair the alarm equipment, and reserves the right to substitute materials
                            of equal quality at time of replacement, or to use reconditioned parts in fulfillment of this
                            warranty. This warranty does not include batteries, electrical surges, lightning damage, software
                            upgrades and repairs, communication devices that are no longer supported by communication pathways,
                            obsolete components and components exceeding manufacturer’s useful life. PS is not the manufacturer
                            of the equipment and other than PS’s limited warranty Subscriber agrees to look exclusively to
                            the manufacturer of the equipment for repairs under its warranty coverage if any. Except as set
                            forth in this agreement, PS makes no express warranties as to any matter whatsoever, including,
                            without limitation, the condition of the equipment, its merchantability, or its fitness for any
                            particular purpose. PS does not represent nor warrant that the security system may not be compromised
                            or circumvented, or that the system will prevent any loss by burglary, hold-up, fire or otherwise;
                            or that the system will in all cases provide the protection for which it is installed. PS expressly
                            disclaims any implied warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability or fitness
                            for a particular purpose. The warranty does not cover any damage to material or equipment caused
                            by accident, misuse, attempted or unauthorized repair service, modification, or improper installation
                            by anyone other than PS. PS shall not be liable for consequential damages. Subscriber acknowledges
                            that any affirmation of fact or promise made by PS shall not be deemed to create an express warranty
                            unless included in this agreement in writing; that Subscriber is not relying on PS's skill or
                            judgment in selecting or furnishing a system suitable for any particular purpose and that there
                            are no warranties which extend beyond those on the face of this agreement, and that PS has offered
                            additional and more sophisticated equipment for an additional charge which Subscriber has declined.
                            Subscriber's exclusive remedy for PS's breach of this agreement or negligence to any degree under
                            this agreement is to require PS to repair or replace, at PS's option, any equipment which is
                            non-operational. This Limited Warranty is independent of and in addition to service contracted
                            under paragraph 1(b)(ii) of this agreement. This Limited Warranty gives you specific legal rights
                            and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state. If required by law, PS will
                            procure all permits required by local law and will provide certificate of workman's compensation
                            prior to starting work.

                            8. FIRE ALARMS: Unless the Schedule of Equipment and Services provides for a fire alarm system to code PS makes no representation
                            that the fire alarm equipment meets local code requirements or constitutes a fire alarm system
                            as that term is defined by the Authority Having Jurisdiction [AHJ] over fire alarm systems in
                            Subscriber’s premises. If a fire alarm system to code is specified in the Schedule of Equipment
                            and Services then PS will install fire alarm equipment pursuant to AHJ requirements. Subscriber
                            agrees that any equipment required by the AHJ not specified in the Schedule of Equipment and
                            Services shall be an extra to this agreement to be paid for by Subscriber at time said additional
                            equipment is requested.

                            9. DELAY IN DELIVERY / INSTALLATION / RISK OF LOSS OF MATERIAL: PS shall not be liable for any damage or loss sustained by
                            Subscriber as a result of delay in delivery and/or installation of equipment, equipment failure,
                            or for interruption of service due to electric failure, strikes, walk-outs, war, acts of God,
                            or other causes, including PS's negligence or failure to perform any obligation. The estimated
                            date work is to be substantially completed is not a definite completion date and time is not
                            of the essence. In the event the work is delayed through no fault of PS, PS shall have such additional
                            time for performance as may be reasonably necessary under the circumstances. Subscriber agrees
                            to pay PS the sum of $1,000 per day for each business day the work is re-scheduled or delayed
                            by Subscriber or others engaged by Subscriber through no fault of PS on less than 24 hour notice
                            to PS.

                            If installation is delayed for more than one year from date hereof by Subscriber or other contractors engaged by Subscriber
                            and through no fault of PS, Subscriber agrees to pay an additional 5% of the contract Purchase
                            Price upon installation. Subscriber assumes all risk of loss of material once delivered to the
                            job site.

                            System which shall remain in the same location as installed. All repairs, replacement or alteration
                            to the security system made by reason of alteration to Subscriber's premises, or caused by unauthorized
                            intrusion, lightning or electrical surge, or caused by any means other than normal usage, wear

                            and service of the security system, and PS shall not be responsible for any condition created
                            thereby as a result of such installation, service, or removal of the security system, and Subscriber
                            represents that the owner of the premises, if other than Subscriber, authorizes the installation
                            of the security system under the terms of this agreement.

                            14. INDEMNITY / WAIVER OF SUBROGATION RIGHTS / ASSIGNMENTS: Subscriber agrees to indemnify and hold harmless PS, its employees,
                            agents and subcontractors, from and against all claims, lawsuits, including those brought by
                            third-parties or by Subscriber, including reasonable attorneys' fees and losses, asserted against

                            under this agreement. Subscriber on its behalf and any insurance carrier waives any right of
                            subrogation Subscriber's insurance carrier may otherwise have against PS or PS's subcontractors
                            arising out of this agreement or the relation of the parties hereto. Subscriber shall not be

                            15. EXCULPATORY CLAUSE: PS and Subscriber agree that PS is not an insurer and no insurance coverage is offered herein. The
                            security equipment and PS’s services are designed to reduce certain risks of loss, though PS
                            does not guarantee that no loss will occur. PS is not assuming liability, and, therefore, shall
                            not be liable to Subscriber for any loss, data corruption or inability to retrieve data, personal
                            injury or property damage sustained by Subscriber as a result of intrusion, burglary, theft,
                            hold-up, fire, equipment failure, smoke, or any other cause whatsoever, regardless of whether
                            or not such loss or damage was caused by or contributed to by PS’s negligent performance to any
                            degree in furtherance of this agreement, any extra contractual or legal duty, strict products
                            liability, or negligent failure to perform any obligation pursuant to this contract or any other
                            legal duty. In the event of any loss or injury to any person or property, Subscriber agrees to
                            look exclusively to Subscriber’s insurer to recover damages. Subscriber releases PS from any
                            claims for contribution, indemnity or subrogation.

                            16. INSURANCE: The Subscriber shall maintain a policy of public liability, property damage, burglary and theft insurance
                            under which PS is named as additional insured. PS shall not be responsible for any portion of
                            any loss or damage which is recovered or recoverable by the Subscriber from insurance covering
                            such loss or damage or for such loss or damage against which the Subscriber is indemnified or
                            insured. In the event of any loss or injury to any person or property, Subscriber agrees to look
                            exclusively to Subscriber’s insurer to recover damages. Subscriber shall obtain insurance to
                            cover any loss the security services are intended to detect to one hundred percent of the insurable
                            value, and Subscriber and all those claiming rights under Subscriber waive all rights against
                            PS and its subcontractors for loss or damages caused by burglary, theft, water, smoke, fire or
                            other perils intended to be detected by the security services or covered by insurance to be obtained
                            by Subscriber, except such rights as they may have to the proceeds of insurance.
                        </div>
                        <div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                            17. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: Subscriber agrees that should there arise any liability on the part of PS as a result of PS's
                            negligent performance to any degree or negligent failure to perform any of PS's obligations pursuant
                            to this agreement or any other legal duty, equipment failure, or strict products liability, that
                            PS's liability shall be limited to the sum of $250.00 or 5% of the sales price or 6 times the
                            aggregate of monthly payments for services being provided at time of loss, whichever is greater.
                            If Subscriber wishes to increase PS's amount of limitation of liability, Subscriber may, as a
                            matter of right, at any time, by entering into a supplemental agreement, obtain a higher limit
                            by paying an annual payment consonant with PS's increased liability. This shall not be construed
                            as insurance coverage.
                        </div>
                        <div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                            18. LEGAL ACTION / EARLY TERMINATION / AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE: The parties agree that due to the nature of the services to
                            be provided by PS, the payments to be made by the Subscriber for the term of the services part
                            of this agreement form an integral part of PS's anticipated profits; that in the event of Subscriber's
                            default it would be difficult if not impossible to fix PS's actual damages. Therefore, in the
                            event Subscriber defaults in any payment or charges to be paid to PS, the balance of all payments
                            for the entire term herein shall immediately become due and payable, and Subscriber shall be
                            liable for 80% thereof as liquidated damages and PS shall be permitted to terminate all its services,
                            including but not limited to terminating monitoring service, under this agreement and to remotely
                            re-program or delete any programming without relieving Subscriber of any obligation herein. If
                            PS prevails in any litigation or arbitration between the parties, Subscriber shall pay PS’s legal
                            fees. In any action commenced by PS against Subscriber, Subscriber shall not be permitted to
                            interpose any counterclaim. The parties agree that they may bring claims against the other only
                            in their individual capacity, and not as a class action plaintiff or class action member in any
                            purported class or representative proceeding. Subject to Subscriber’s right to bring any claim
                            against PS for up to $1,000 in small claims court having jurisdiction, any dispute between the
                            parties or arising out of this agreement, including issues of arbitrability, shall, at the option
                            of any party, be determined by arbitration before a single arbitrator administered by Arbitration
                            Services Inc., under its Arbitration Rules www.ArbitrationServicesInc.com, except that no punitive
                            damages may be awarded. The arbitrator is authorized to conduct proceedings by telephone, video
                            or by submission of papers. The arbitrator is authorized to conduct proceedings by telephone,
                            video or by submission of papers. Service of process or papers in any legal proceeding or arbitration
                            between the parties may be made by First-Class Mail delivered by the U.S. Postal Service addressed
                            to the party's address in this agreement or another address provided by the party in writing
                            to the party making service. Subscriber submits to the jurisdiction and laws of Arizona and agrees
                            that any litigation or arbitration between the parties must be commenced and maintained in the
                            county where PS’s principal place of business is located. The parties waive trial by jury in
                            any action between them unless prohibited by law. Any action by Subscriber against PS must be
                            commenced within one year of the accrual of the cause of action or shall be barred. </div>
                        <div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                            All actions or proceedings against PS must be based on the provisions of this agreement. Any other action that Subscriber
                            may have or bring against PS in respect to other services rendered in connection with this agreement
                            shall be deemed to have merged in and be restricted to the terms and conditions of this agreement,
                            and this consent to arbitrate shall survive the termination of this agreement.
                        </div>

                            19. PS'S RIGHT TO SUBCONTRACT SPECIAL SERVICES: Subscriber agrees that PS is authorized and permitted to subcontract any
                            services to be provided by PS to third parties who may be independent of PS, and that PS shall
                            not be liable for any loss or damage sustained by Subscriber by reason of fire, theft, burglary
                            or any other cause whatsoever caused by the negligence of third parties. Subscriber appoints
                            PS to act as Subscriber’s agent with respect to such third parties, except that PS shall not
                            obligate Subscriber to make any payments to such third parties. Subscriber acknowledges that
                            this agreement, and particularly those paragraphs relating to PS's disclaimer of warranties,
                            exemption from liability, even for its negligence, limitation of liability and indemnification,
                            inure to the benefit of and are applicable to any assignees, subcontractors, manufacturers, vendors
                            and central offices of PS.
                        </div>
                        <div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                            20. MOLD, OBSTACLES AND HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS: Subscriber shall notify PS in writing of any undisclosed, concealed or hidden
                            conditions in any area where installation is planned, and Subscriber is responsible for removal
                            of such conditions. In the event PS discovers the presence of suspected asbestos or other hazardous
                            material, PS shall stop all work immediately and notify Subscriber. It shall be Subscriber’s
                            sole obligation to remove such conditions from the premises, and if the work is delayed due to
                            the discovery of suspected asbestos or other hazardous material or conditions then an extension
                            of time to perform the work shall be allowed and Subscriber agrees to compensate PS for any additional
                            expenses caused by the delay but not less than $1000.00 per day until work can resume. If PS,
                            in its sole discretion, determines that continuing the work poses a risk to PS or its employees
                            or agents, PS may elect to terminate this agreement on 3 day notice to Subscriber and Subscriber
                            shall compensate PS for all services rendered and material provided to date of termination. PS
                            shall be entitled to remove all its equipment and uninstalled equipment and material from the
                            job site. Under no circumstances shall PS be liable to Subscriber for any damage caused by mold
                            or hazardous conditions or remediation thereof.
                        </div>

                        <div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                            21. NON-SOLICITATION: Subscriber agrees that it will not solicit for employment for itself, or any other entity, or employ,
                            in any capacity, any employee of PS assigned by PS to perform any service for or on behalf of
                            Subscriber for a period of two years after PS has completed providing service to Subscriber.
                            In the event of Subscriber's violation of this provision, in addition to injunctive relief, PS
                            shall recover from Subscriber an amount equal to such employee's salary based upon the average
                            three months preceding employee's termination of employment with PS, times twelve, together with
                            PS's counsel and expert witness fees.

                            22. FALSE ALARMS / PERMIT FEES: Subscriber is responsible for all alarm permits and fees, agrees to file for and maintain
                            any permits required by applicable law and indemnify or reimburse PS for any fines relating to
                            permits or false alarms. PS shall have no liability for permit fees, false alarms, false alarm
                            fines, police or fire response, any damage to personal or real property or personal injury caused
                            by police or fire department response to alarm, whether false alarm or otherwise, or the refusal
                            of the police or fire department to respond. In the event of termination of police or fire response
                            by the municipal police or fire department this agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force
                            and Subscriber shall remain liable for all payments provided for herein. Should PS be required
                            by existing or hereafter enacted law to perform any service or furnish any material not specifically
                            covered by the terms of this agreement Subscriber agrees to pay PS for such service or material.

                            23. FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT: In compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), the Subscriber hereby authorizes
                            PS to obtain a consumer credit report. Subscriber has the right, by contacting the provider of
                            this information, to dispute the information on the report or request additional disclosures
                            as provided under Section 606 of the FCRA. Written request must be given from the Subscriber
                            to PS to request additional credit information. Subscriber releases all persons involved in the
                            credit investigation from liability in connection with such investigation.

                            understanding of the parties and may not be amended, modified or canceled, except in writing
                            signed by both parties, except PS’s requirements regarding items of protection provided for in
                            this agreement imposed by Authority Having Jurisdiction. Subscriber acknowledges and represents
                            that Subscriber has not relied on any representation, assertion, guarantee, warranty, collateral
                            agreement or other assurance, except those set forth in this Agreement. Subscriber hereby waives
                            all rights and remedies, at law or in equity, arising, or which may arise, as the result of Subscriber’s
                            reliance on such representation, assertion, guarantee, warranty, collateral agreement or other
                            assurance. Should any provision of this agreement be deemed void, the remaining parts shall not
                            be affected. This agreement shall run concurrently with and shall not terminate or supersede
                            any existing agreement between the parties unless specified herein.

                            A3. If your Services include emergency two-way voice over a cellular or internet connection, you acknowledge that the two-way
                            voice connection may be interrupted or unable to connect, that the call may be dropped, and that
                            the sound quality may be distorted or impossible to understand. By accepting the emergency two-way
                            voice service you understand and accept the limitations inherent in cellular and internet technology
                            and the consequences if the technology does not operate as designed. If your Services include
                            video or still-photo image cameras, the video clips and still-photo images generated from such
                            cameras are stored on our servers and may be viewed by you only for a limited time based on the
                            quantity of storage you have ordered from your Dealer. We have no control over and take no responsibility
                            for the placement of cameras and their view. You agree to use the cameras and associated video
                            and still-photo imaging features of the Services in compliance with all laws, including privacy
                            and consumer protection laws, and not for any illegal purposes, including invasion of privacy
                            or illicit conduct, and we may disconnect the cameras from the Services if you, in our sole determination,
                            breach this covenant. We do not guarantee the receipt, clarity or quality of any images that
                            may be adversely impacted by, for example, lighting, Internet and wireless communication facilities
                            and transmission quality, electrical interference, weather and other conditions beyond our control.
                            We may disclose stored video clips and still-photo images in response to a subpoena or a government
                            request or order. If the Equipment provided by your Dealer includes an Alarm.com image sensor
                            device that also is being used as a motion sensor, then you understand and accept that the motion
                            sensor may not operate as designed and may be affected by conditions outside our control, which
                            may cause the device to malfunction or provide false readings. If the Equipment provided by your
                            Dealer includes home automation devices (such as thermostats, lighting controls and door locks),
                            you understand that such devices may not work together with the Equipment and Alarm.com Services,
                            and you may be unable to control the devices using the Equipment or Alarm.com Services. Alarm.com
                            makes no representations or warranties regarding the quality, function or effectiveness of any
                            such home automation devices.
